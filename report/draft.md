Global Capital Reallocation Under Structural Shocks: An Empirical Framework for Valuation Dispersion, Earnings Sensitivity and Regime-Dependent Capital Rotation

Abstract

This paper develops a cross-region empirical framework to analyze how structural macroeconomic shocks alter valuation dispersion, earnings sensitivity, time-varying macro betas, and capital reallocation dynamics across global equity markets. Using monthly data across major developed and emerging regions, we estimate region- and sector-level sensitivities to macro shocks, compute rolling exposure measures, segment regimes using policy and volatility indicators, and examine how cross-border capital flows respond to divergence in macro exposures and valuation dispersion. We find that structural shocks generate asymmetric earnings responses across regions, that rolling macro betas vary significantly across tightening and easing cycles, and that divergence in these exposures predicts subsequent capital reallocation. Valuation dispersion rises sharply at regime transition points and amplifies flow volatility. A composite signal incorporating dispersion, beta divergence, and flow acceleration provides economically meaningful forward allocation implications. The results suggest that global asset allocation must incorporate regime-dependent macro sensitivity rather than rely on static correlation structures.

Introduction

Global equity markets do not respond uniformly to macroeconomic shocks. Monetary tightening cycles, inflation regime shifts, liquidity contractions, and global growth slowdowns propagate through heterogeneous sector compositions, fiscal structures, and financial systems. The United States exhibits strong sensitivity to real rates through its growth and duration-heavy equity composition. Europe exhibits heightened sensitivity to inflation dynamics and energy shocks. Japan remains partially insulated from global rate cycles through domestic monetary policy persistence. Emerging markets display heightened exposure to global liquidity conditions and currency fluctuations. These structural asymmetries imply that macro shocks should induce predictable capital rotation across regions and sectors.

Traditional global allocation models rely on static correlations and long-run average betas. Such models implicitly assume that exposures are stable and that macro transmission channels do not vary meaningfully across regimes. Empirical evidence from multiple tightening and easing cycles contradicts this assumption. Market beta with respect to policy rates, inflation surprises, or financial conditions varies substantially across time. Furthermore, cross-sectional valuation dispersion widens during periods of macro stress, suggesting increasing disagreement or differential sensitivity across firms and sectors. This widening dispersion is frequently accompanied by sharp shifts in cross-border capital flows.

The objective of this study is to construct a unified empirical framework that links structural macro shocks to earnings response coefficients, rolling macro betas, valuation dispersion, and observed capital reallocation patterns. The goal is not merely descriptive but diagnostic and forward-looking. By quantifying how sensitivity divergence across regions evolves, we aim to infer allocation implications under alternative macro scenarios.

Literature Context

The relationship between cross-sectional dispersion and expected returns has been widely studied. Research shows that dispersion in firm valuations and returns contains information about aggregate volatility and future equity premia. Higher dispersion often corresponds to greater uncertainty in macro transmission and heterogeneous earnings expectations. Empirical evidence suggests that dispersion predicts volatility and, in some specifications, excess returns. Parallel literature documents the sensitivity of cross-border capital flows to global interest rates, financial conditions, and risk sentiment. Reports from the International Monetary Fund and the Institute of International Finance consistently demonstrate that emerging market flows are particularly sensitive to shifts in global liquidity conditions and US monetary policy cycles. The time-varying nature of macro betas has also been documented in the context of regime-switching models and rolling window estimations, where factor exposures evolve in response to volatility and policy regimes.

This study contributes by integrating these strands into a coherent empirical structure. Rather than examining dispersion, flows, or betas in isolation, we analyze their joint dynamics under structural macro shocks.

Data

The analysis uses monthly data covering the United States, Europe, Japan, and Emerging Markets over the period 2000 to 2025. Equity variables include index-level total returns, forward earnings growth, and forward price-to-earnings ratios. Sector-level aggregates are used to capture within-region heterogeneity. Macro variables include policy rate changes, inflation rates, GDP growth surprises, term spreads, financial conditions indices, and broad US dollar measures. Capital flow data consist of cross-border equity fund flows and regional ETF flows, scaled by assets under management to normalize across regions.

All series are aligned to monthly frequency. Earnings growth is computed as year-over-year change in forward earnings expectations. Valuation dispersion is measured as the cross-sectional standard deviation of log forward P/E ratios within each region across sectors.

Methodology

We begin by estimating earnings sensitivity to macro shocks. For region r and sector s, earnings growth is modeled as a linear function of macro shocks. The regression specification includes region-sector fixed effects and controls for global risk conditions. Coefficients capture how strongly earnings respond to rate changes, inflation surprises, and growth shocks. These parameters represent structural transmission channels and are allowed to differ across regions and sectors.

Next, we compute rolling macro betas of regional equity returns with respect to policy rate changes and financial conditions indices. A 36-month rolling window is used to estimate time-varying sensitivity. The resulting beta series reveal how exposure to macro variables evolves through tightening, easing, and crisis regimes. Divergence is defined as the deviation of a region’s beta from the cross-regional average at each point in time.

Valuation dispersion is computed monthly. We examine its behavior across regimes and its correlation with subsequent flow volatility. Dispersion is hypothesized to rise when macro shocks produce heterogeneous sectoral impacts, thereby increasing disagreement and risk premia.

Capital reallocation is analyzed by regressing subsequent regional flow changes on dispersion, beta divergence, and valuation gaps. This approach tests whether investors allocate capital toward regions with more favorable macro exposure and lower internal dispersion.

Regimes are identified using both threshold methods and volatility-adjusted classifications. Tightening regimes are defined as sustained periods of positive policy rate changes above historical norms. Easing regimes correspond to sustained rate reductions. Crisis regimes are characterized by elevated volatility and negative growth shocks.

Results

Earnings sensitivity estimates reveal systematic cross-regional differences. Emerging markets exhibit strong negative sensitivity to global rate increases, reflecting dependence on external financing and currency channels. The United States displays meaningful rate sensitivity concentrated in growth sectors, while defensive sectors are less affected. Europe demonstrates pronounced inflation sensitivity, consistent with sector composition and energy exposure. Japan shows muted direct rate sensitivity but reacts to global growth and currency dynamics.

Rolling betas vary substantially across regimes. During early tightening phases, regional betas to rate changes rise as markets reprice duration risk. Late in tightening cycles, betas compress as expectations of peak policy rates emerge. During easing onsets, beta signs often reverse, reflecting improved risk appetite. Divergence across regions increases near regime inflection points, indicating asymmetry in macro exposure.

Valuation dispersion rises sharply during macro transition periods. Dispersion peaks during crisis episodes and at the onset of aggressive tightening cycles. Elevated dispersion precedes periods of increased capital flow volatility, suggesting that dispersion contains forward information about reallocation intensity.

Flow regressions demonstrate that regions with declining macro betas relative to peers attract capital following tightening peaks. Conversely, regions with rising beta divergence experience outflows. Dispersion interacts with beta divergence, amplifying the magnitude of flow adjustments.

Scenario simulations indicate that a positive 100 basis point global rate shock disproportionately reduces earnings growth in emerging markets relative to developed markets. Valuation dispersion widens in rate-sensitive regions, triggering reallocation toward relatively insulated regions. Under easing scenarios, the pattern reverses as higher-beta regions experience inflow acceleration.

Portfolio Implications

The empirical findings imply that static global allocation weights fail to capture regime-dependent macro exposure divergence. A tactical allocation strategy that overweights regions with lower macro beta, narrowing dispersion, and positive flow momentum generates superior risk-adjusted returns relative to a passive global benchmark in historical simulations. The strategy particularly outperforms during regime transitions.

Risk Considerations

The framework relies on linear approximations and rolling window estimations, which may understate nonlinearities during extreme crises. Flow data may be noisy and subject to reporting lags. Structural breaks in macro policy regimes could alter sensitivity parameters. Nonetheless, robustness checks using alternative windows and regime definitions confirm the stability of core relationships.

Conclusion

Structural macro shocks produce heterogeneous earnings responses, time-varying macro betas, and predictable capital reallocation patterns across global equity regions. Valuation dispersion acts as an amplification mechanism during regime transitions. The integration of dispersion metrics, rolling beta divergence, and flow diagnostics provides a systematic and empirically grounded framework for forward global asset allocation. Incorporating regime-dependent macro exposure into allocation models enhances robustness relative to static correlation approaches.

Future extensions include nonlinear regime-switching estimation, currency-adjusted beta decomposition, and sector-neutral allocation overlays. The central implication remains clear: global capital rotation under structural shocks is measurable, systematic, and exploitable when modeled through a unified sensitivity-dispersion-flow framework.
